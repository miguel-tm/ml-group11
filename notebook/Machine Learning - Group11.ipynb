    "## 1. Introduction & Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Overview\n",
    "- **Tittle**: Predicting Diabetes Risk Using Health Indicators\n",
    "- **Hypothesis**: Lifestyle and clinical factors (such as exercise frequency, BMI, blood pressure, smoking habits, and diet) significantly influence diabetes risk. Machine learning models can be used to accurately predict whether an individual is diabetic/pre-diabetic, or healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Description\n",
    "- **Name**: CDC diabetes Dataset\n",
    "- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository\n",
    "- **Link**: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators\n",
    "- **Note**: out of the 3 databases available this is the one used:\n",
    "diabetes _ binary _ health _ indicators _ BRFSS2015.csv is a clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_binary has 2 classes. 0 is for no diabetes, and 1 is for prediabetes or diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables and is not balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Description**: The Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset contains healthcare statistics and lifestyle survey information about people in general along with their diagnosis of diabetes. In total there are over 250,000 instances. The dataset contains 21 features consisting of demographics, lab test results, and answers to health-related survey questions for each patient. The target variable for classification is whether a patient is diabetic/pre-diabetic, or healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables**: The dataset includes 21 input features, a mixture of continuous and binary features. The target variable for classification is whether a patient is diabetic/pre-diabetic = 1, or healthy = 0. See cell below with a table with all the variables details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Considerations\n",
    "- The way the target variable is mapped allows for binary classification: 0 = no diabetes, 1 = prediabetes or diabetes\n"
